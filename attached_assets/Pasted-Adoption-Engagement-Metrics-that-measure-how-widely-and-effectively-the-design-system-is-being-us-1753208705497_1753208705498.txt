Adoption & Engagement
Metrics that measure how widely and effectively the design system is being used by teams.
Adoption Rate: Calculate the percentage of products, teams, or projects actively using the design system's libraries and components.
Component & Library Usage: Use tools like Figma analytics to track how many components and libraries are being used and how frequently.
Contributions to the System: Monitor the number of contributions (e.g., new components, bug fixes) from various teams, indicating a collaborative and valued system.
Documentation Visits: Measure engagement with the design systemâ€™s documentation to see if it's a helpful and frequently used resource.
Team Satisfaction Surveys: Collect qualitative feedback from design, development, and product teams to gauge their satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
Participation & Support: Track attendance at design system meetings ("office hours") and the number of support questions, which should decrease as the system matures.
Product & Design Efficiency
Metrics focused on the design process and the quality of the design artifacts.
Time to Market: Measure the reduction in time it takes to go from an initial idea to a launched product or feature.
Prototype Speed: Track the acceleration in how quickly new feature prototypes can be created and tested.
Component Library Health:
Total Components: Monitor the growth of reusable components in the system.
Component Detachments (Figma): Track how often designers detach from components, which can signal gaps or usability issues in the system.


Design Review Time: Measure the reduction in time spent in design review cycles due to a shared understanding of patterns and components.
Onboarding Time: Monitor the time saved when onboarding new designers and developers, as they can get up to speed with established patterns quickly.
Development & Engineering Efficiency
Metrics focused on the development process, code quality, and engineering effort.
Design-to-Development Handoff Time: Measure the speed and efficiency of the handoff process between design and development teams.
Average Task Completion Time: Compare the time developers spend on UI-related tasks before and after the design system's implementation.
Reduction in Technical Debt: Track the decrease in UI-related technical debt by measuring the reuse of standardized, pre-vetted code.
Code Complexity: Monitor for a reduction in code complexity and the need for refactoring, thanks to component reuse.
Linter Warnings: Track the number of UI-related linter warnings, which should decrease significantly with a standardized codebase.
System-Wide Update Efficiency: Measure the reduction in time and effort required to implement system-wide design changes or platform upgrades.
Quality & User Experience
Metrics that measure the impact of the design system on the final product and the end-user's experience.
UI Consistency: Track and measure the reduction in visual inconsistencies, UI bugs, and user-reported discrepancies across products.
Reduction in Design Debt: Monitor the decrease in the number of design debt tickets and "snowflake" components (one-off designs).
Accessibility Improvements:
Accessibility Score: Track improvements in automated accessibility audit scores (e.g., WCAG compliance).
Accessibility Issues: Measure the decrease in accessibility-related bugs found during QA testing.


User Satisfaction: Monitor changes in user satisfaction scores (e.g., CSAT, NPS) related to the product's interface and usability.
Task Completion Rates: Measure improvements in the success rate of users completing key tasks within the product.
Support Ticket Reduction: Track the decrease in support tickets related to UI confusion or usability problems.
