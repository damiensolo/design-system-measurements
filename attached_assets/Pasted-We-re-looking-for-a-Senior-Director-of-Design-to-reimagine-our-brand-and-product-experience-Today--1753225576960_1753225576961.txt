You hold a high bar for exceptional design, have strong opinions, and can evangelize excellence in design and craft across the company
You're willing to throw away good ideas in pursuit of great ones
You believe in showing, not telling â€“ preferring tangible demos and prototypes over lengthy documents and decks
