Feature: AI-Powered Checklist Chat Assistant
Objective:
Enhance each checklist item with contextual AI-powered chat functionality that supports users in understanding and completing tasks more effectively.

🧩 Feature Overview
This feature introduces an interactive “Ask AI” capability to each checklist item in the Design System Checklist. The user can invoke a contextual chat assistant trained on the topic of that specific task. The AI assistant provides on-demand help, examples, and clarification directly within the flow of the checklist UI.

🖼 UX States (Based on Screenshots)
1. Idle State (Hover to Reveal AI Prompt Button)
📷 Screenshot 1

When the user hovers over a checklist item (e.g., "Return on Investment"), a contextual button labeled “Ask AI” appears beside the item title.

On mouse blur, the button is hidden again to preserve minimal UI clutter.

2. Engaged State (User Clicks Ask AI)
📷 Screenshot 2

Clicking “Ask AI” expands an AI chat input field just beneath the checklist item title.

The input field contains a default prompt:

"What would you like to learn about [Checklist Title]?"
(e.g., "What would you like to learn about Return on Investment (ROI)?")

💬 Chat Functionality
Once the chat input is revealed:

The user can initiate a conversation with an LLM that is pretrained on the subject matter of the checklist item.

A full conversational chat experience begins, in a mini chat UI, anchored directly under the relevant task.

The AI offers examples, clarifications, and guidance specific to the checklist item topic.

The chat can be used iteratively until the user is satisfied.

❌ Exit Behavior
The user must be able to close or minimize the chat thread.

Closing the thread resets the checklist item back to its original collapsed state with the checkbox and hover behavior intact.

🔁 Repeatability
Every checklist item includes this AI-powered chat capability.

The interaction pattern is consistent across all items to reduce cognitive load.

🧪 UX Goals
Keep the core checklist UI clean and focused by showing chat UI only on demand.

Keep interactions contextual, scoped, and dismissable.

Ensure the LLM is optimized to deliver useful, scoped answers for each checklist domain.
